## how app functions:


This Next.js app showcases a list of Pokémon with the option to add them to a favorites page. The app uses a custom hook to fetch Pokémon data from an external API and displays it on the homepage in individual cards. Each card includes a button to add or remove the Pokémon from the favorites list, which is managed through a context. The favorites page displays all Pokémon marked as favorites, allowing users to easily view and manage their selected Pokémon.
